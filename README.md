# MonsterScalingTool
Scale a monster's stats to fit any CR while keeping the overall feel the same! For DnD 5E only.

Have you ever wanted to fight a CR 20 Commoner or a CR 3 Dragon?

Sometimes when coming up with encounters for Dungeons and Dragons 5th edition, you might find a monster that looks really fun but realize it's the wrong CR for your party. Maybe you want to adjust it to be a more appropriate challenge? Or, maybe you want to run a published adventure for 5th level players but you just reached 10th level with your buddies?

On page 274 of the DMG is a table that lists the typical values of the following stats for a monster of any given Challenge Rating (CR).

Proficiency Bonus\
Armor Class\
Hit Points\
Attack Bonus\
Damage/Round\
Save DC

This tool works by looking at the stats entered for a certain monster and comparing them to the average values in the table for a monster of the same CR, calculating a ratio for each one. The tool then looks at the average stat values for a monster of the CR you want to scale it to and multiplies them by that ratio. This has the effect of adjusting the stats to be in line with the new CR in a proportionate way, keeping the general "feel" of the monster intact. If a CR 2 monster has twice as much HP as the average CR 2 monster, scaling it to CR 10 will give it twice as much HP as the average CR 10 monster.

What this basically means is that after you increase or decrease their CR, glass cannon monsters will still be glassy and beefy tanks will still be beefy. The one caveat is that it doesn't take into account more complex monster features such as ability scores, spell slots, or action economy. I'm planning to update the tool over time so that it can better handle stuff like that, but for now it's a good idea to double check the results and decide how to incorporate the suggested values.

For example, if you scale up a monster so that it is doing twice as much damage as the original version, you will need to decide whether it's best to give them twice as many attacks or to simply double the damage die for their existing attacks. In general, I would recommend the route of giving them more attacks as four low power attacks are a more stable source of damage than two high power attacks that can suddenly and abruptly change the course of a fight. However, if the starting monster already made four attacks, you probably don't want to increase that even higher. Perhaps consider a new damage source, like a reaction ability, additional turns, or even legendary actions!

Overall, the tool works best with simple monsters that just hit and get hit, but more complex monsters can be adjusted as well.
